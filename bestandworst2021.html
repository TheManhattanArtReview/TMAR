<p>Let's be honest, the ratings don't mean much. They're just a shorthand for my feelings towards a show, and my criteria for rating shifts over time, not to mention the influence of my mood in a particular moment. Thus the best shows from this year aren't simply the highest rated, they also do something other than being successful exhibitions. Six of the ten shows are of new work, but all of them felt new in a way that, to my memory, no other shows did this year. New is an inarticulate word, like novel, fresh, innovative, etc., so a better term might be "alive." I saw plenty of good historical art, but, like museums, the effect is a bit like seeing pinned butterflies: beautiful, but dead. I'm not a Tony Conrad/Henry Flynt museum abolitionist, but I might be if I lived in New York in the '60s when more than ten art shows a year has some life to them. As it is, it's better to be reminded that art used to have some vitality than it is to be left with what we have now and risk forgetting altogether. What all these shows have in common, if nothing else, is that they felt irreducible, pushed by their own internal forces to a place outside of the reach of any easy categorization. What exactly that place is is a question beyond the scope of language, but in my defense all art should go beyond language, even if it only seldom does. The images that stick out in my mind are the ones I feel I understand the least, like the barely-there but still adequate layout of the Duryee-Browner show, or Johns' apparently now-infamous combination of a map of the universe combined with a shunga print, which aside from the surprise of pornography struck me as perhaps the most contemporary image I've seen all year, whatever that means. That a 91 year-old is the one that did it is also something I don't understand.</p>

<p>Even the most memorably bad show is less memorable than the most unremarkable good show; bad art is bad because there's nothing interesting about it. If it was interesting it would be good; hence camp. These shows only stood out by the amount of attention I didn't give to them. Even that Triest show never kept me up at night, although the same doesn't seem to be true for others involved.</p>

<p>Postscript - Correction:<br>- Frank Bowling - London/New York - <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/31600-frank-bowling-london-new-york">Hauser & Wirth</a> - ****</p>

<p>This is the only review I've done yet that I've fully doubled back on. I was turned off by the continents in his paintings at the time as some kind of stupid commercialism, but in retrospect it's actually a very funny kind of stupid and he's a talented painter with a distinct approach to abstraction. I wouldn't do another review just off of photos (Hauser's documentation is weirdly incomplete anyway), but I do wish I could see it again.</p>
