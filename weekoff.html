<p>Hello,</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my recent Instagram Q&A, The Manhattan Art Review is unmonetized. Every review and editorial I've posted since November 2019 has made me no direct income, and although the attention I've received for my writing has allowed me to make a bit of money through side projects such as merchandise, studio visits, and banner ads, it has all amounted to very little. I have recently started to do some writing for other publications, but at the moment a sense of productivity remains my only compensation for the vast majority of the work I do. I do have a Patreon, and in spite of being very bad at posting exclusive content (I'm working on it), I thought I should take this opportunity to ask that you consider subscribing to it as a way of showing your support if you appreciate my writing and have the means. My Patreon URL is https://www.patreon.com/themanhattanartreview, and there's also a link to it at the top of my site.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
	Sean Tatol</p>
