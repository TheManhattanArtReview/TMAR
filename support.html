<p><strong>Support The Manhattan Art Review during the Fractured Atlas Spring Match campaign</strong></p>

<p>My fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, is distributing $1,000 to 20 different projects for their annual Spring Match campaign. Every donation that you make to the Manhattan Art Review between Monday, April 15 and Friday, April 19 equals one extra chance for us to receive the $1k, so I'm here to ask for your support! Click here to make a donation of any amount to improve our odds, and be sure to share our fundraiser far and wide&mdash;every donation counts! Fractured Atlas is a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of the Manhattan Art Review are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>
