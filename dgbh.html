As i mentioned before, i have been spend a lot of time in my life to trying to know the goodness and the beauty that is difficult to feel instantaneously. Because i know there are the existences of beautiful things and good things as certainly, even if it's does not have superficial beauty or goodness.<br>
My family is suffering from illness, and they are often depressed, so in most cases the atmosphere of our house is gloomy. But i know that they are desperately trying to live. There is no appear as superficial beauty, but if could try to feel something, i think that there are certainty beauty and goodness. And trying to know them is gives us a powerful and fresh perspective as will change the meanings of the riverside in the pictures.<br>
I have been do them as a private research so far. Because i was felt it's difficult to share them with others until now (except for some people like you). But as i talking you now about the concepts of this art show, if i will talk a little about what i'm trying to do, i thought more people may be will try to understand the meanings of what i'm saying.<br>
In 0100011110001 projects, i have been avoided expressing what 0100011110001  trying to does by words. So i have decided to start a new project, and dgbh was born (so dgbh and 0100011110001 are different things, so can you make a new page for  dgbh?).<br>
I visited the riverside in the pictures for several months many times. I can feel the energies just by looking at the landscapes(I think you can feel it too), but i think most of people feel like it's just a riverside.<br>
But when see those records with the my talk, their meaning may change for those people. Or, it may will not change, but i think that is also interesting.<br>
Please exhibit the SD card (Micro SD card), USB memory, and 5 pictures (please change the pictures when viewers want) at On Purpose, and please talk viewers about my concepts i talked. And this art show will be completed!<br>
I'm very happy that do this art show! Thank you!:)))]<br>- dgbh<br>
