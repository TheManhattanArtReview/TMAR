<p><strong>A Short Response to Ben Davis' Response to "Negative Criticism"</strong></p>

<p>I recently published <a href="https://thepointmag.com/criticism/negative-criticism/">a piece</a> called "Negative Criticism" for <i>The Point</i>, which has garnered a lot of responses: a two-part reaction from Ben Davis on Artnet, <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/sean-tatol-negative-reviews-part-1-2353302">one</a>, <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/sean-tatol-negative-criticism-part-2-2353305">two</a>, two responses to <i>his</i> response on <i>Two Coats of Paint</i>, <a href="https://twocoatsofpaint.com/2023/08/on-negative-criticism.html">one</a>, <a href="https://twocoatsofpaint.com/2023/09/part-2-on-negative-criticism.html">two</a> (oddly, I get the distinct sense that Stevenson didn't read a word of anything he was supposed to be responding to), and, as of today, a further Artnet podcast by Davis and Kate Brown, <a href="https://news.artnet.com/multimedia/the-art-angle-podcast-state-of-art-criticism-2358970">here</a>, although they mention they only recorded the podcast because the viral painter Davis had planned to interview backed out. I hadn't planned to respond, mostly because I felt there wasn't much to respond to. He nitpicks more than he challenges, and as far as I can tell his stance is simply "we need more perspectives," as if that's something I disagree with. I decided to write something though, because I feel the direction of his argument judiciously (if not consciously) sidesteps what I see at stake in my criticism and in art in general, which is that both art and criticism are perhaps in the worst state they've ever been. Such a position seems off-limits for Davis, who likes to capitulate to things being relative while insisting that there's a difference between relativism and pluralism: art's always been good and bad, there's always been debates on the use of criticism, there's plenty of critics writing negative criticism (without citing any names). The main source of irritation to me is that I feel like I'm being given the classic liberal runaround, deflecting and whatabouting away the fundamental fact that something is wrong and isn't being addressed by the current state of art and criticism. I have a position I'm taking, which you can agree or disagree with, but Davis seems only able to uphold the status quo. There are dim concessions that people aren't very interested in criticism or the art world right now, but attributing it to the proliferation of voices on the internet, while not incorrect, feel inadequate. There's a clear contradiction in his claim that there are lots of negative critics today while simultaneously attributing the attention my work has received to little more than my negativity. Why aren't these other negative critics popular? Why haven't my imitators caught on as well? I review more shows than anyone I'm aware of, sure, but I believe there's something else at stake that's not being addressed in his critique. Bluntly, most art criticism is unspeakably dull, and "Negative Criticism" was fundamentally an attempt to grapple with why that is and what I see as a solution.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't see "Negative Criticism" as much of a success. My original goal had been to articulate the process of constructing subjectivity through criticality, but I'm not satisfied with how I covered that. Not long after its publication I happened to read Oscar Wilde's <a href="https://celt.ucc.ie/published/E800003-007/text001.html">"The Critic as Artist"</a> which does a much better job than I do, and Ross Simonini sent me an <a href="https://www.affidavit.art/articles/better-than-satisfaction">old article of his</a> that he was reminded of while reading "Negative Criticism" which I think addresses individuation much more directly than my own piece does. I also just finished Thomas Crow's <a href="https://archive.org/details/intelligenceofar0000crow"><i>The Intelligence of Art</i></a>, which is a good read in its own right but specifically manages in its first five pages to articulate the fundamental use of writing about art, namely to mediate and convey something of the experience of art, as well as the way in which the popularity of academic theorizing in art, in the manner of Freud, Lacan, Foucault, etc., had to some degree served to obscure the problem of addressing artworks phenomenologically. That's not to imply that Crow or myself are conservatives who dislike those thinkers, but just that, in the heady postmodern '80s, the aesthetic and historiographic study was dismissed in favor of abstracted theoretical interpretation, which isn't inherently bad but is I think responsible for a lot of the excesses of political advocacy and so on that we have now in art. Crow's subject in that book is art history, not criticism, but in a way that's relevant because I read a lot more art history than art criticism. Between a Met catalogue on Fra Angelico and Greenberg's collected criticism, both of which I'm reading now, it's no contest that I like the Met book more. And Greenberg is (I guess) my favorite critic! It's true that criticism gets dated almost immediately, but my preference is a more fundamental issue. I like reading about art to learn about art, and criticism is rarely the best venue for that. To hazard an offhand definition, art history helps to establish and clarify the reader's judgments (I already know I like Angelico, but reading essays on research into his paintings makes me more engaged with his works and therefore more appreciative and discerning) whereas art criticism exercises the critic's judgments (Processing what Greenberg likes and dislikes generally helps us to understand Greenberg more than it does the art, although it is fun to try to see what he sees in a piece he loves or hates). If I have any sense of judgment, it's been built more by a study of art than a study of criticism. If I learned anything from Robert Christgau, it was, aside from how to be blithe, only that he taught me what a strongly opinionated perspective looked like.</p>

<p>This brings me to contemporary critics. Can you name a working critic that actually uses their judgments? Peter Schjeldahl, who Davis seems to think highly of, is quoted in Davis' second response (critical disinterestedness)
You're not liable to see a negative review in <i>Artforum</i> unless it's calling John Currin misogynist. For the same matter with Davis, he disagrees with my judgment of Barbara Ess, but I have no idea why, except that he think her work "suggests thought." To nitpick his nitpicking, taking me to task for describing her work as "operating on some NYC punk rock frequency" when, ackchyually, she's no wave, is frankly condescending, as if I've never heard of no wave or if there's no aesthetic bleed between the two that makes gloomy pinhole shots of grungy '80s New York distinctly no wave and not punk. The distinction is uselessly pedantic as regards the art. More importantly, if he wanted to give two examples of my writing, why did he choose two reviews that are two sentences long? That seems to me like a pointed decision that borders on bad faith, as if he could only address my writing if he reduced it to nothing but curt flippancy. Those two reviews are intended to be curt and flippant, that's why they're two sentences long! He could have picked any number of more substantial pieces, where I actually said something, 
caring about art is like caring about life
